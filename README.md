## Project Structure
 * `main.go`: The main entry point for the application.
 * `inputhandler/handler.go`: Handles user input and calls calculation functions.
 * `calculation/average.go`: Calculates the average of a slice of float64 numbers.
 * `calculation/range.go`: Calculates the range based on mean and standard deviation.
 * `calculation/standarddev.go`: Calculates the standard deviation from variance.
 * `calculation/variance.go`: Calculates the variance of a slice of float64 numbers.

## Usage
